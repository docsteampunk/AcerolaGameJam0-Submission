# AcerolaGameJam0-Submission
Made for the 2024 Acerola Game Jam. Theme: Abberation. Made with Godot Game Engine.

All of this is Open-Source as per the rules of game-jam. The code is 100% free to use and public domain. Ian Taylor's color conversion code is able to be used without attribution but I just did it because the guy is a pretty cool dude.
